# Generate Random OHLCV Test Data

The name OHLCV comes from Open, High, Low, Close and Volume.

OHLCV is a file format used for analyzing bitcoin markets. A file has
one record for each opening date. The values tracked are the open,
high, low and close prices in US dollars. The total volume of trades
is also given, again in US dollars.

The currency is represented with an integer type. I choose to view it
as US cents, but the script itself has no such bias. The granularity
is hourly. A simple script modification could produce data of finer
granularity, producing much larger output files.

Ohlcv.py is written in Python 3. It has no dependencies on third-party
packages. There is no need to install it: just run it as it is. It is
safe as it only writes text data to stdout. It does not modify the
run-time environment and makes no use of the network.

The data generated by ohlcv.py is purely random. It does not try to
model a realistic market. It may be useful for testing based on the
format of the data, but is unlikely to be of any use for testing
analytic tools.

Example:
```
sqlite3 ohlcv.db <ohlcv-schema.sql
./ohlcv.py sql > ohlcv-insert.sql
sqlite3 ohlcv.db <ohlcv-insert.sql
sqlite3 ohlcv.db <ohlcv-queries.sql 
```
